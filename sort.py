# Given a file containing a list of dictionaries implement a sorting algorithm (of your choosing) that will sort the list
# based on the dictionary keys.
# The dictionary keys will contain alphabetic characters while the values will be integers.
# The rule for comparing dictionaries between them is:
# if the value of the dictionary with the lowest alphabetic key is lower than the value of the other dictionary with the
# lowest alphabetic key, then the first dictionary is smaller than the second.
# if the two values specified in the previous rule are equal reapply the algorithm ignoring the current key.
#
# The input is a file containing the list of dictionaries. Each dictionary key value is specified on the same line in the
# form <key> <whitespace> <value>. Each list item is split by an empty row. The output is a file containing a list of
# integers specifying the dictionary list in sorted order. Each integer identifies a dictionary in the order they were
# received in the input file.
